this project is created by Yeung Ching Fung and Chan Pak Yin

Buttons: 
	"Denoise? " : this button turns the denoise function on or off, if it shows "Denoise? Y", the data will undergo a denoise function. 
		      the default is "Denoise? N", which is off.

	the button with a circle : this button controls the voice change on/off, if the circle is grey, it starts voice changing,
				   else if the circle is red, the voice won't be processed. The default is off.

	the button with mic  : this button control the on/off of the mic, if the shows black, no data will be passed to the function, it does when it is green.
			       the default is black

Slide bars:
	"pitch mul" : this bar controls how many time the frequency is lifted, if it is 2, the frequencies will become twice, ie 120Hz -> 240Hz
	
	"pitch add" : this bar controls how many frequency level will be added to the lifted voice data, to add more control to the function

	"Input volume" : this bar controls the amplitude of the input data
	
	"output volume" : this bar controls the amplitude of the output data, adjusting this bar to a lower level is recommended as female voice usually has lower
			  dynamic (strength) than man.
